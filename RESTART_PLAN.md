## Why This Will Work

1. **Planning is done** - 50,000 words of strategic guidance ready
2. **Code is solid** - 8.5/10 quality, tests passing
3. **Market is hot** - AI/vector search demand growing
4. **Timeline is realistic** - 14 weeks is achievable
5. **Risk is mitigated** - Hybrid path has fallbacks

## What's Different This Time

**Before:** Planning phase (strategy, analysis, documentation)  
**Now:** Execution phase (building, shipping, selling)

**The shift:** From thinking to doing.

**Next Action:** Complete Pre-Week-1 checklist above, then start Week 1 Monday morning.

Let's build this! 🚀

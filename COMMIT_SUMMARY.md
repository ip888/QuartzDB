## Key Recommendations

### ⭐ Recommended Path: C (Hybrid)

**Why:**
- ✅ Lowest risk (FaaS is fallback)
- ✅ Highest upside ($30K-100K/month passive + acquisition)
- ✅ Multiple revenue streams
- ✅ Realistic 14-week timeline
- ✅ De-risks everything

### Deployment Strategy

**Use BOTH Platforms:**
1. **Cloudflare Workers** (FaaS Layer)
   - Simple operations
   - Global distribution
   - <$20/month cost
   - True "edge-first"

2. **DigitalOcean** (Backend/Enterprise)
   - Complex operations
   - Persistent data
   - Enterprise features
   - $5-40/month cost

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Keep DigitalOcean (no changes)
- Week 3-4: Add Cloudflare Workers layer
- Week 5-6: Hybrid routing & testing
- Week 7: Launch FaaS (first revenue!)
- Week 8+: Scale both simultaneously
